# Project Title

Alumni Donate Platform

## Project Description


We are formulating a Web-based Alumni Platform which will facilitate effective communication through online chatting, profile viewing, Volunteer programs, donations and personal messaging within members of the Alumni Association.

This platform will be providing direct contact of the alumni with the College Administrators. The desired query of the existing and new developments will be answered faster.

This portal highlights the feature of communication, which will enable the new and old alumnus to have interactions with each other and also the College. Various updates on recent activities of the college, Internship opportunity, sponsored projects and donations in assisting the college will be highlighted. In this project we proposed the Dynamic Architectural design of the Alumni platform, which enabled an enhanced interaction and communication between the College and Alumnus.
